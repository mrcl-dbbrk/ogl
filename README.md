# ogl
This is some WIP OpenGL stuff of mine.
It has some rudimentary capabilities to load '.obj' files.
It makes use of OpenGL version 2.1 and GLSL 1.20 and I might try to make it work with the respective versions of OpenGL ES and WebGL.
This is really early into construction and it's maybe going to be the basis for some simple 3D modeling or prototyping software.
At this point this project is probably hardly of any use to anyone except myself and I most likely forgot a whole bunch of commas in this sentence.
